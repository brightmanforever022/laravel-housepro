                            </li>
                            <li>The payment procedure shall be in accordance with the following provisions:
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>The contract is concluded by the total price displayed at the end of the booking. This is made up of the rental price and the processing fee. APARTOLINO notifies the users of their content, including the presentation of the total price, after booking.</li>

                                  </li>
                                  <li> The hirer already has APARTOLINO with the booking confirmation to transfer the deposit 24 hours after the start of the stay in the hired accommodation to the offerer.

                                  <li> Users can only offset claims against APARTOLINO's processing fees if they are due and legally established or undisputed. The assignment of claims to third parties is excluded.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                            </li>
                            <li>There is a refutable presumption that a supplier is an entrepreneur and is aware of its (turnover) tax obligations and is duly fulfilling it as long as he does not communicate anything to APARTOLINO. APARTOLINO is entitled to demand appropriate proof of the entrepreneur's property.</li>
                            <li>The landlord reserves the right to make further consumption and usage-dependent costs (in particular: electricity, water, heating) additionally to be asserted locally.

                    <li>Term, Termination
                        <ol>
                            <li>The contract of use is concluded indefinitely.</li>
                            <li>It can be terminated by the user at any time without observing a notice period. A notification to APARTOLINO in text form (eg letter, fax, e-mail) is sufficient for a declaration of termination. Already proven or mediated leases of the user with other users remain unaffected by a termination of the usage contract. The same applies to claims due for payment of the processing fee.</li>
                            <li>APARTOLINO may terminate the contract of use at any time with a period of two weeks.</li>

                                <li>  The user does not comply with a not insignificant payment obligation in whole or in part despite a reminder with an appropriate deadline</li>

                                <li>The user violates his obligations under these terms and conditions and does not make a timely remedy despite a warning with a deadline. A reminder is not necessary if this does not promise success or the infringement is so serious that APARTOLINO is not reasonable to stick to the contract. Furthermore, the seriousness of the infringement may also result from the fact that the user has already been warned several times because of a comparable infringement;</li>
                                <li> Requirements of the legislator, court or authority that the use of the platform can no longer be offered in this form;</li>
                                <li>APARTOLINO ceases the platform or its business;</li>
                                <li>The opening of an insolvency proceedings over the assets of the user is rejected for lack of mass.</li>

                    <li> Measures for legal and / or breach of contract by the user
                        <ol>
                            <li>APARTOLINO may, subject to termination without notice, terminate one or more of the following, if there are concrete indications that a User is guilty of breach of statutory provisions, rights of third parties or the GTC, or if APARTOLINO has other legitimate interests, in particular to protect members from fraudulent activities Take action: 
                                <ol type="A">
